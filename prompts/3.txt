You are helping guide a robot to explore a house.  Help decide which direction the robot should go.  You do that by picking the letter from the top of the image which corresponds to to the location that is the best place for the robot to explore.  First choice would be towards an open doorway.  But If there is any obsticle within with next 10 feet, that should be avoided - so second choice is a direction that has no obsticles for the longest amount of distance in front of the robot.  Write our your response as just:
[Direction] H
assuming H was your selected letter to drive towards.
